Inline CSS Webpage
This is a basic HTML webpage showcasing the use of inline CSS styling. It features my first coding project from class, including text formatting, image styling, and link adjustments. The project highlights the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS.
Key Features:
	•	Inline CSS for text, images, and links
	•	Centered image with custom borders and shadows
	•	Link to VIN Industries
This project is part of my journey into web development, and I’m excited to continue building and learning!
